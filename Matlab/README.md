## Description

Matlab code to compute perturbed topological signature (PTS) from a persistence diagram (PD).

## Software requirements

The code was developed using Matlab-2017b. However, the code should work for any version of Matlab that has the required packages installed.

## Folder contents

* [Datasets](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/tree/master/Matlab/Datasets) - This folder contains PDs of WKS, HKS and SIHKS spectral descriptors computed over the [SHREC 2010](http://morpheo.inrialpes.fr/~wuhrer/data/uploads/publications/non-rigid-shrec10.pdf) 3D shape dataset. The persistence diagrams are saved as .mat files. Each .mat file contains a 200x3 cell. The 200 rows correspond to the 200 shapes. The first column contains the shape's file-name, the second column contains the numerical class-label and the thrid column contains a 10x1 cell which contains the PDs for a shape, obtained using 10 different spectral descriptor scales.

* [main.m](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/blob/master/Matlab/main.m) - This file first extracts the PTS representations from PDs of the SHREC 2010 dataset. After extracting the PTS features, a distance matrix is generated by computing the amount of similarity/difference between the PTS features using two different Grassmannian metrics. Finally, using the computed distance matrix the 1-nearest neighbor classification accuracy is calculated.
