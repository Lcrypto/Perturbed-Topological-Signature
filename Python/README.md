* os
* time
* numpy
* scipy
* pickle

## Folder contents

* [Datasets](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/tree/master/Python/Datasets) - This folder contains PDs of the SIHKS spectral descriptor computed over the [SHREC 2010](http://morpheo.inrialpes.fr/~wuhrer/data/uploads/publications/non-rigid-shrec10.pdf) 3D shape dataset. The persistence diagrams are saved as pickle (.pckl) files. The .pckl file contains a list of length 200, where each list element contains information about each shape. Each element in this list has another nested list of length 3. The first element of the nested list contains the shape's file-name, the second element contains the numerical class label and the third element has the PDs.

* [main.m](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/blob/master/Matlab/main.m) - This file first extracts the PTS representations from PDs of the SHREC 2010 dataset. After extracting the PTS features, a distance matrix is generated by computing the amount of similarity/difference between the PTS features using two different Grassmannian metrics. Finally, using the computed distance matrix the 1-nearest neighbor classification accuracy is calculated.

* [Normalize_PD.m](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/blob/master/Matlab/Normalize_PD.m) - This function normalizes the PD (passed as input) w.r.t. the largest death-time in the PD. The function assumes that the PD has the following structure [birth-time, death-time], with death-time > birth-time. 

* [Random_perturbation.m](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/blob/master/Matlab/Random_perturbation.m) - This function takes the normalized PD and parameters as input. This function generates a set of randomly perturbed PDs. Each randomly perturbed PD has its points shifted by a certain amount w.r.t. the original PD.

* [PDFs_from_PDs.m](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/blob/master/Matlab/PDFs_from_PDs.m) - This function takes the set of randomly perturbed PDs and parameters as input. The function generates the 2D probability density function (PDF) of the PDs using kernel density estimation.

* [map_to_Grassmannian.m](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/blob/master/Matlab/map_to_Grassmannian.m) - This function takes the set of 2D PDFs and parameters as input. The function maps the set of 2D PDFs to a point on the Grassmann manifold.

* [subspace_angles.m](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/blob/master/Matlab/subspace_angles.m) - This function computes the minimal geodesic distance between two points on the Grassmann manifold.

* [distChordalGrass.m](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/blob/master/Matlab/distChordalGrass.m) - This function computes the chordal distance between two points on the Grassmann manifold.

* [NearestNeighbor.m](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/blob/master/Matlab/NearestNeighbor.m) - This function takes the distance matrix and labels as input and returns the one nearest neighbor classification accuracy.
