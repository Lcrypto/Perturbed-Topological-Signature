## Folder contents

* [Datasets](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/tree/master/Matlab/Datasets) - This folder contains PDs of WKS, HKS and SIHKS spectral descriptors computed over the [SHREC 2010](http://morpheo.inrialpes.fr/~wuhrer/data/uploads/publications/non-rigid-shrec10.pdf) 3D shape dataset. The persistence diagrams are saved as .mat files. Each .mat file contains a 200x3 cell. The 200 rows correspond to the 200 shapes. The first column contains the shape's file-name, the second column contains the numerical class-label and the thrid column contains a 10x1 cell which contains the PDs for a shape, obtained using 10 different spectral descriptor scales.

* [main.m](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/blob/master/Matlab/main.m) - This file first extracts the PTS representations from PDs of the SHREC 2010 dataset. After extracting the PTS features, a distance matrix is generated by computing the amount of similarity/difference between the PTS features using two different Grassmannian metrics. Finally, using the computed distance matrix the 1-nearest neighbor classification accuracy is calculated.

* [Normalize_PD.m](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/blob/master/Matlab/Normalize_PD.m) - This function normalizes the PD (passed as input) w.r.t. the largest death-time in the PD. The function assumes that the PD has the following structure [birth-time, death-time], with death-time > birth-time. 

* [Random_perturbation.m](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/blob/master/Matlab/Random_perturbation.m) - This function takes the normalized PD and parameters as input. This function generates a set of randomly perturbed PDs. Each randomly perturbed PD has its points shifted by a certain amount w.r.t. the original PD.

* [PDFs_from_PDs.m](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/blob/master/Matlab/PDFs_from_PDs.m) - This function takes the set of randomly perturbed PDs and parameters as input. The function generates the 2D probability density function (PDF) of the PDs using kernel density estimation.

* [map_to_Grassmannian.m](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/blob/master/Matlab/map_to_Grassmannian.m) - This function takes the set of 2D PDFs and parameters as input. The function maps the set of 2D PDFs to a point on the Grassmann manifold.

* [subspace_angles.m](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/blob/master/Matlab/subspace_angles.m) - This function computes the minimal geodesic distance between two points on the Grassmann manifold.

* [distChordalGrass.m](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/blob/master/Matlab/distChordalGrass.m) - This function computes the chordal distance between two points on the Grassmann manifold.

* [NearestNeighbor.m](https://github.com/anirudhsom/Perturbed-Topological-Signature/blob/master/Matlab/NearestNeighbor.m) - This function takes the distance matrix and labels as input and returns the one nearest neighbor classification accuracy.
